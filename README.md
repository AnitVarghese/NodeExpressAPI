# NodeExpressAPI
I've created a simple API using Node and Express using the Get, Post, Patch, Delete operations on Postman(API Platform).

# Simple Node.js and Express API

This project is a simple RESTful API built using Node.js and Express. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP methods: GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. The API can be tested using Postman or any other API testing tool.
